# A* Algorithm Visualization

### Description:
- Implementing A*, the extension for Dijkstra's Algorithm, with Python.
- Uses PyGame for the visualization, Tkinter for the settings, python's queue module for the algorithm implementation. 

### Demo:
<img src="https://github.com/matanbt/A-Star-Algorithm-Visualization/blob/master/img/demo.png" width=400>
Starts from the GREEN node, 
 Ends in the RED node, 
 Shortest path marked in PURPLE.

### Notes:
- Could be implemented asymptotically more efficient  using Fibonacci Heap.
- Running the Dijkstra-version (via settings), on this grid, is BFS de-facto.
